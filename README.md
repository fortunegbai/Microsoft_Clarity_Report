# Microsoft Clarity UX Analysis: Heatmaps & Session Recordings


![](./images/Cover_Page.png)

## Executive Summary
Why do users leave a page before reaching the footer or rage-click on harmless hero text? These moments often signal deeper UX issues that quietly hurt engagement and conversions.

To find answers, I analyzed Microsoft Clarity’s public demo data from April 25 to May 1, 2025. I explored heatmaps and session recordings across desktop and mobile, studying how real people navigate and react.

Key insights stood out:

- Hero sections attract attention but sometimes confuse users when text looks clickable but isn’t.

- Modals and calls-to-action engage people but can fall short when the next step isn’t clear.

- Entire parts of a page stay ignored, suggesting wasted space that could offer something more valuable.

For product managers, designers, and business leaders, insights like these replace assumptions with facts. This project shows how I turn user behavior into practical ideas for better design and stronger business results.
